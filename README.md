# Mapping Faroe Islands

Small project to clean, process and visualize some OpenStreetMap data on Faroe Islands.

Data and geometries are downloaded from https://www.geofabrik.de/, a great project in cooperation with OSM aiming to create a freely usable world map.

The great thing about GeoFabrik is that you can download daily updated excerpts and derived data from the OpenStreetMap dataset organised by region. 

GeoFabrik maps OSM data formats to the usual GIS formats to make the OSM data accessible to more people. 

Quoting from https://www.geofabrik.de/data/, OSM rules on how to map certain features are often not well defined and there is no mandatory quality control. 
This openness allows a lot of flexibility and is part of the reason why OSM has been able to collect so much data in such a short time frame, but it makes using the data more difficult.
When using or exporting the data, many decisions have to be made on how to extract the different features into something usable for the task at hand.
GeoFabrik has specified a general-use mapping of the basic features like roads, waterways, different land use types, and points of interest. 

I downloaded the excerpt of Faroe Island on April 2020. Unless major changes will occurr on OSM and GeoFabrik layering specifications, you should be able to reproduce my plots easily (I did not uploaded data in this repo).

If you want more details feel free to reach out!
